# SalinaPlaningMill.com
Site Purpose
   This project is designed to recreate SalinaPlaningMill.com from its 2006 coldfusion webpage to a more modern HTML5 webpage.
Steve Dunning had requested that we recreate the webpage in it's original image with modern elements. Include a Menu icon for mobile platforms.

Pages/Topics of pages
  The wire frame called for 19 pages in all and we added additional links to AWI and AGC companies. covering all the projects, products and information about thier company.

Features
  The major feature of the website are informing visitors of what they have to offer in a products page, showing off past projects they have worked on. There is a method of contact that is incomplete

Design decisions
  Our design evolved as we went along, with the mindset the Steve Dunning owner of Salina Planing Mill stated in an interview he did not want to go crazy with wood textures and wood elements all over the page. I leaned on Dan to do a lot of the color scheme and in the end Dan & I agreed on a parchment texture wrapped in the classic blue that the original page used, which Dan felt looked better wrapped in grey. This grey area could be covered with a neat image or gradient however time was running short on the project and with only so many hours to go around we still had to line up elements of the page. 

Problems and challenges encountered
  The project proved more difficult with each passing week as I painfully spent hours researching how to do certain things to accomplish what I felt was in the best interest of the webpage and Steve's image for his webpage. I had begun the project using elements taught in class with classic div's and tables, lists to align the page and by the end of the class more tools were added into the toolbox. Tools like bootstrap and flexbox. However when trying to incorporate bootstrap it wanted to overwrite some of my css and classes I had already defined. Flexbox eventually came in handy when I wished to prevent the footer from invading the space of other div elements in the webpage. Table's proved specially usefull for aligning elements but don't play nice when on a mobile platform as their boxes and content can only get so small before going off the edge of the screen.

Knowledge/experience gained.
  I Learned a lot and fully enjoyed working on the webpage, I am inspired to continue to learn more about webpage content and am curious as to where it could get me in the future. With more experiance and tools I could grow on this and make extra money or even a career out of web developement and enjoy my future in the industry.
